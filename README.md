This is the Repository for the planned paper

'Starshaped Subgroup Discovery with Uniform Generalization Guaranteess' 

The implementation of the subgroup discoveries (including statistical tests and regularization) is done with the R-package 'oofos' ( https://github.com/schollmeyer/oofos )

There are different applications from different fields: Social science, psychometrics, biology, machine learning (from which only one will later be contained in the paper):

    Dimensions of social justice ( R Code :...... )
    Item impact in Cognitive Diagnosis Models ( R Code: Application_example_cognitive_diagnosis_modeling.R )
    IRT dataset anxiety ( http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/ )
    Gene expression data set(s)
    UCI dataset credit_g ( from https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=31&status=active )


The gene expression datasets can be found under:
